This page lists commercial PD/CP devices with which the LibOSDP counterpart was
tested to work (or not work).

The data found here is mostly sourced from the users and should be treated with
a grain of salt as both sides of this comparison may evolve to have different
versions and hence varying behaviour. Nevertheless, it's a good starting point.

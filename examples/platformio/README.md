# PlatformIO Arduino Examples

LibOSDP provides a native port for [PlatformIO][1]. If you have it already
setup, you can set `lib_deps=https://github.com/goToMain/libosdp` in your
`platformio.ini` and build your CP/PD application as you would build any
PlatformIO project.

Note: These examples are provided only for demonstration purposes. A real world
CP/PD device would have to do a lot more.
